**Antepartum Summary is a content profile that defines the structure for the aggregation of significant events, diagnoses, and plans of care derived from the visits over the course of an antepartum episode. **

**This profile is intended to be a summary for supporting pregnancy care prior to and leading up to delivery.**

### Conformance Expectations

IHE uses the normative words: Shall, Should, and May according to [standards conventions](https://profiles.ihe.net/GeneralIntro/ch-E.html).

#### Must Support

The use of ```mustSupport``` in StructureDefinition profiles equivalent to the IHE use of **R2** as defined in [Appendix Z](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.10-profiling-conventions-for-constraints-on-fhir).

mustSupport of true - only has a meaning on items that are minimal cardinality of zero (0), and applies only to the source actor populating the data. The source actor shall populate the elements marked with MustSupport, if the concept is supported by the actor, a value exists, and security and consent rules permit.
The consuming actors should handle these elements being populated or being absent/empty.
Note that sometimes mustSupport will appear on elements with a minimal cardinality greater than zero (0), this is due to inheritance from a less constrained profile.
